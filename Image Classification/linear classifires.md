### Deep Neural Networks and Linear Classifiers

Deep neural networks are often compared to **Legos**, where each component builds upon the other. A **linear classifier** serves as one of the most fundamental building blocks for these networks.

However, before diving deeper into neural networks, we first revisit **CIFAR-10** for further understanding.

### Parametric Approach and Efficient Models

In a **parametric approach**, we summarize training data into a set of parameters **W**, making the model more efficient at test time.

### Understanding the Function of a Linear Classifier

A linear classifier processes images by flattening them into vectors and applying weights.

For example, when classifying planes, the classifier might learn to recognize blue backgrounds and blobby structures.

> "The classifier for planes looks for blue stuff and blobby stuff, making it favor planes more." *(53:58)*

### Decision Boundaries and Limitations

Linear classifiers attempt to separate categories using linear boundaries.

However, linear classifiers struggle with **multimodal data** where categories exist in non-continuous clusters.

### Conclusion

Linear classification provides a foundational approach to categorization, but struggles in complex, multimodal scenarios.
