# Image Classification and Computer Vision

## Introduction
- **Primary focus**: Image classification problem (ImageNet Challenge).
- **Setup**: Algorithm classifies images into a fixed set of categories.
- **Object detection**: Identifies objects and their locations in images.
- **Image captioning**: Generates natural language descriptions of images.

## History of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
- **AlexNet (2012)**: First deep CNN that won the ImageNet Challenge.
  - Originally called **Supervision**.
  - Had **7-8 layers**.
- **Trend**: Networks have become deeper each year.
- **Predecessors**:
  - Jan LeCun’s CNN (1998) for digit recognition at Bell Labs.

## Key Innovations Enabling CNNs
1. **Computational advancements**
   - **Moore’s Law**: Exponential growth in computational power.
   - **GPUs**: Enabled efficient parallelized computations.
2. **Availability of large datasets**
   - ImageNet and other large, high-quality labeled datasets.
   - Orders of magnitude larger than 1990s datasets.
3. **Higher capacity models**
   - More data enabled training of deeper networks.

## Expanding the Scope of Computer Vision
- **Beyond image classification**:
  - **3D understanding**: Reconstructing the world from images.
  - **Activity recognition**: Identifying actions in videos.
- **Human visual system vs. AI**:
  - Humans can understand images in milliseconds.
  - AI still lacks deep, true understanding.

## Future of Computer Vision
- **Challenges ahead**:
  - True semantic understanding of images.
  - Generalization beyond labeled datasets.
- **Exciting research areas**:
  - **Andreij Karpathy’s insights**: Understanding humor and context in images.
  - **Fei-Fei Li’s studies**: Human-level rapid image understanding.

**Conclusion**  
Computer vision has made **massive progress**, but **many exciting challenges remain**. The future holds **new opportunities** for innovation in deep learning and AI.
