## The Growth of Visual Data and Computer Vision

### Massive Visual Data Growth
- The world has more cameras than people, generating enormous amounts of visual data daily.
- A 2015 CISCO study estimated that by 2017, 80% of internet traffic would be video.
- Majority of internet bits are visual data, making algorithm development crucial for understanding it.

### Challenges in Understanding Visual Data
- Visual data is difficult to interpret and is often referred to as "the dark matter of the internet."
- Similar to dark matter in physics, visual data is abundant but hard to analyze effectively.

### YouTube and the Scale of Video Content
- Every second, around five hours of video is uploaded to YouTube.
- Manually watching and annotating all videos is impossible; automated understanding is necessary.

### Interdisciplinary Nature of Computer Vision
- **Physics:** Optics and image formation.
- **Biology & Psychology:** Understanding how brains process vision.
- **Computer Science & Mathematics:** Core principles for building vision systems.

## History and Evolution of Computer Vision

### Early Vision Studies and Theories
- Ancient times: **Camera Obscura** in the Renaissance period.
- 1960s: Studies on cat brains helped uncover how neurons respond to visual stimuli.
- David Marr (MIT) proposed computational models of vision.

### Key Developments in the 1990s - 2000s
- **Statistical Machine Learning Techniques:**
  - Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
  - Boosting methods (AdaBoost for face detection)
- **Feature-based Recognition:**
  - SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) for object recognition.

### Rise of Large Datasets and Deep Learning
- Early 2000s: Better digital images led to improved datasets.
- **ImageNet (2009):**
  - 15M+ images, 22,000 categories.
  - ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) became the benchmark for vision models.

### Breakthrough in 2012: Deep Learning Revolution
- **AlexNet (2012):**
  - Drastically reduced error rates.
  - Marked the shift towards deep neural networks for vision tasks.

### Future of Computer Vision
- Growth in real-world applications like self-driving cars, medical imaging, and augmented reality.
- Ongoing advancements in neural networks continue to push the boundaries of AI-driven vision.
